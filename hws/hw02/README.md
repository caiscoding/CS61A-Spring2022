# Required questions

Several doctests refer to these functions:

```py
from operator import add, mul

square = lambda x: x * x

identity = lambda x: x

triple = lambda x: 3 * x

increment = lambda x: x + 1
```

## Parsons Problems

To work on these problems, open the Parsons editor:

```
python3 parsons
```

### Q1: Count Until Larger

Implement the function `count_until_larger`. `count_until_larger` takes in a positive integer `num`. `count_until_larger` counts the distance between the rightmost digit of `num` and the nearest greater digit; to do so, the function counts digits from right to left. Once it encounters a digit larger than the rightmost digit, it returns that count. If no such digit exists, then the function returns `-1`.

For example, `8117` has a rightmost digit of `7` and returns a count of `3`. `9118117` also returns a count of `3`: for both, the count stops at `8`.

`0` should be treated as having no digits and returns a count of `-1`.

Consult the following doctests for specific behaviors of `count_until_larger`.

```py
def count_until_larger(num):
    """
    Complete the function count_until_larger that takes in a positive integer num.
    count_until_larger examines the rightmost digit and counts digits from right to
    left until it encounters a digit larger than the rightmost digit, then returns that count.

    >>> count_until_larger(117) # .Case 1
    -1
    >>> count_until_larger(8117) # .Case 2
    3
    >>> count_until_larger(9118117) # .Case 3
    3
    >>> count_until_larger(8777)  # .Case 4
    3
    >>> count_until_larger(22) # .Case 5
    -1
    >>> count_until_larger(0) # .Case 6
    -1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

### Q2: Filter Sequence

Write a function `filter_sequence` which takes in two integers, `start` and `stop`, as well as a function `cond`, which takes in a single argument and outputs a boolean value. `filter_sequence` returns the sum of all digits from `start` to `stop` (inclusive) for which `cond` returns `True`.

```py
def filter_sequence(cond, start, stop):
    """
    Returns the sum of numbers from start (inclusive) to stop (inclusive) that satisfy
    the one-argument function cond.

    >>> filter_sequence(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, 0, 10) # .Case 1
    30
    >>> filter_sequence(lambda x: x % 2 == 1, 0, 10) # .Case 2
    25
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

## Code Writing Questions

### Q3: Hailstone

Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

The number `n` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of `n` is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name `n`, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at `n`, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:

```py
def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    >>> b = hailstone(1)
    1
    >>> b
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Hailstone sequences can get quite long! Try 27. What's the longest you can find?

> Note that if `n == 1` initially, then the sequence is one step long.

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q hailstone
```

### Q4: Product

The `summation(n, term)` function from the higher-order functions lecture adds up `term(1) + ... + term(n)`. Write a similar function called `product` that returns `term(1) * ... * term(n)`.

```py
def product(n, term):
    """Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence.

    n: a positive integer
    term:  a function that takes one argument to produce the term

    >>> product(3, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3
    6
    >>> product(5, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    120
    >>> product(3, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    36
    >>> product(5, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 5^2
    14400
    >>> product(3, increment) # (1+1) * (2+1) * (3+1)
    24
    >>> product(3, triple)    # 1*3 * 2*3 * 3*3
    162
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q product
```

### Q5: Accumulate

Let's take a look at how `summation` and `product` are instances of a more general function called `accumulate`, which we would like to implement:

```py
def accumulate(merger, start, n, term):
    """Return the result of merging the first n terms in a sequence and start.
    The terms to be merged are term(1), term(2), ..., term(n). merger is a
    two-argument commutative function.

    >>> accumulate(add, 0, 5, identity)  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    15
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 5, identity) # 11 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    26
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 0, identity) # 11
    11
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)   # 11 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2
    25
    >>> accumulate(mul, 2, 3, square)    # 2 * 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    72
    >>> # 2 + (1^2 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (3^2 + 1)
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: x + y + 1, 2, 3, square)
    19
    >>> # ((2 * 1^2 * 2) * 2^2 * 2) * 3^2 * 2
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: 2 * x * y, 2, 3, square)
    576
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: (x + y) % 17, 19, 20, square)
    16
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

`accumulate` has the following parameters:

- `term` and `n`: the same parameters as in `summation` and `product`
- `merger`: a two-argument function that specifies how the current term is merged with the previously accumulated terms.
- `start`: value at which to start the accumulation.

For example, the result of `accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)` is

```
11 + square(1) + square(2) + square(3) = 25
```

> **Note**: You may assume that `merger` is commutative. That is, `merger(a, b) == merger(b, a)` for all `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, you may not assume `merger` is chosen from a fixed function set and hard-code the solution.

After implementing `accumulate`, show how `summation` and `product` can both be defined as function calls to `accumulate`.

**Important**: You should have a single line of code (which should be a `return` statement) in each of your implementations for `summation_using_accumulate` and `product_using_accumulate`, which the syntax check will check for.

Use Ok to test your code:

```
python3 ok -q accumulate
python3 ok -q summation_using_accumulate
python3 ok -q product_using_accumulate
```

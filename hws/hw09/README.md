# Homework 9: Finale

This homework has nothing you need to submit to `ok`. Rather, there are 3 surveys you need to fill out.

This homework is worth 2 points (out of a total of 16 for homework).

- Fill out the [UC Berkeley course evaluations](https://course-evaluations.berkeley.edu/),
- Complete the [61A end-of-semester survey](https://go.cs61a.org/final-survey), and
- [Vote](https://go.cs61a.org/scheme-voting) on your favorite [Scheme art](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp22/proj/scheme_gallery).

1 point will be assigned for completing the 61A end-of-semester survey. 1 point will be assigned for voting on Scheme art.

If 700 or more students complete all three items, then all students who submit the end-of-semester survey get an extra credit point!

    """A Buffer provides a way of accessing a sequence of tokens across lines.

    Its constructor takes an iterator, called "the source", that returns the
    next line of tokens as a list each time it is queried, or None to indicate
    the end of data.

    The Buffer in effect concatenates the sequences returned from its source
    and then supplies the items from them one at a time through its pop_first()
    method, calling the source for more sequences of items only when needed.

    In addition, Buffer provides a current instance attribute to look at the
    next item to be supplied, without sequencing past it.

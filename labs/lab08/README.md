## Iterators

An iterable is any object that can be iterated through, or gone through one element at a time. One construct that we've used to iterate through an iterable is a for loop:

```py
for elem in iterable:
    # do something
```

`for` loops work on any object that is iterable. We previously described it as working with any sequence -- all sequences are iterable, but there are other objects that are also iterable! We define an **iterable** as an object on which calling the built-in `iter` function returns an iterator. An **iterator** is another type of object that allows us to iterate through an iterable by keeping track of which element is next in the sequence.

To illustrate this, consider the following block of code, which does the exact same thing as the `for` statement above:

```py
iterator = iter(iterable)
try:
    while True:
        elem = next(iterator)
        # do something
except StopIteration:
    pass
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- First, the built-in `iter` function is called on the iterable to create a corresponding iterator.
- To get the next element in the sequence, the built-in `next` function is called on this iterator.
- When `next` is called but there are no elements left in the iterator, a `StopIteration` error is raised. In the for loop construct, this exception is caught and execution can continue.

Calling `iter` on an iterable multiple times returns a new iterator each time with distinct states (otherwise, you'd never be able to iterate through a iterable more than once). You can also call `iter` on the iterator itself, which will just return the same iterator without changing its state. However, note that you cannot call `next` directly on an iterable.

Let's see the `iter` and `next` functions in action with an iterable we're already familiar with -- a list.

```py
>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> next(lst)             # Calling next on an iterable
TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator
>>> list_iter = iter(lst) # Creates an iterator for the list
>>> list_iter
<list_iterator object ...>
>>> next(list_iter)       # Calling next on an iterator
1
>>> next(list_iter)       # Calling next on the same iterator
2
>>> next(iter(list_iter)) # Calling iter on an iterator returns itself
3
>>> list_iter2 = iter(lst)
>>> next(list_iter2)      # Second iterator has new state
1
>>> next(list_iter)       # First iterator is unaffected by second iterator
4
>>> next(list_iter)       # No elements left!
StopIteration
>>> lst                   # Original iterable is unaffected
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Since you can call `iter` on iterators, this tells us that that they are also iterables! Note that while all iterators are iterables, the converse is not true - that is, not all iterables are iterators. You can use iterators wherever you can use iterables, but note that since iterators keep their state, they're only good to iterate through an iterable once:

```py
>>> list_iter = iter([4, 3, 2, 1])
>>> for e in list_iter:
...     print(e)
4
3
2
1
>>> for e in list_iter:
...     print(e)
```

> **Analogy:** An iterable is like a book (one can flip through the pages) and an iterator for a book would be a bookmark (saves the position and can locate the next page). Calling `iter` on a book gives you a new bookmark independent of other bookmarks, but calling `iter` on a bookmark gives you the bookmark itself, without changing its position at all. Calling `next` on the bookmark moves it to the next page, but does not change the pages in the book. Calling `next` on the book wouldn't make sense semantically. We can also have multiple bookmarks, all independent of each other.

### Iterable Uses

We know that lists are one type of built-in iterable objects. You may have also encountered the `range(start, end)` function, which creates an iterable of ascending integers from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive).

```py
>>> for x in range(2, 6):
...     print(x)
...
2
3
4
5
```

Ranges are useful for many things, including performing some operations for a particular number of iterations or iterating through the indices of a list.

There are also some built-in functions that take in iterables and return useful results:

- `map(f, iterable)` - Creates an iterator over `f(x)` for `x` in `iterable`. In some cases, computing a list of the values in this iterable will give us the same result as [`func(x)` for `x` in `iterable`]. However, it's important to keep in mind that iterators can potentially have infinite values because they are evaluated lazily, while lists cannot have infinite elements.
- `filter(f, iterable)` - Creates an iterator over `x` for each `x` in `iterable` if `f(x)`
- `zip(iterables*)` - Creates an iterator over co-indexed tuples with elements from each of the `iterables`
- `reversed(iterable)` - Creates an iterator over all the elements in the input iterable in reverse order
- `list(iterable)` - Creates a list containing all the elements in the input `iterable`
- `tuple(iterable)` - Creates a tuple containing all the elements in the input `iterable`
- `sorted(iterable)` - Creates a sorted list containing all the elements in the input `iterable`
- `reduce(f, iterable)` - Must be imported with `functools`. Apply function of two arguments `f` cumulatively to the items of `iterable`, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.

## Generators

We can create our own custom iterators by writing a *generator function*, which returns a special type of iterator called a **generator**. Generator functions have `yield` statements within the body of the function instead of `return` statements. Calling a generator function will return a generator object and will not execute the body of the function.

For example, let's consider the following generator function:

```py
def countdown(n):
    print("Beginning countdown!")
    while n >= 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1
    print("Blastoff!")
```

Calling `countdown(k)` will return a generator object that counts down from `k` to 0. Since generators are iterators, we can call `iter` on the resulting object, which will simply return the same object. Note that the body is not executed at this point; nothing is printed and no numbers are outputted.

```py
>>> c = countdown(5)
>>> c
<generator object countdown ...>
>>> c is iter(c)
True
```

So how is the counting done? Again, since generators are iterators, we call `next` on them to get the next element! The first time `next` is called, execution begins at the first line of the function body and continues until the `yield` statement is reached. The result of evaluating the expression in the `yield` statement is returned. The following interactive session continues from the one above.

```py
>>> next(c)
Beginning countdown!
5
```

Unlike functions we've seen before in this course, generator functions can remember their state. On any consecutive calls to `next`, execution picks up from the line after the `yield` statement that was previously executed. Like the first call to `next`, execution will continue until the next `yield` statement is reached. Note that because of this, `Beginning countdown!` doesn't get printed again.

```py
>>> next(c)
4
>>> next(c)
3
```

The next 3 calls to `next` will continue to yield consecutive descending integers until 0. On the following call, a `StopIteration` error will be raised because there are no more values to yield (i.e. the end of the function body was reached before hitting a `yield` statement).

```py
>>> next(c)
2
>>> next(c)
1
>>> next(c)
0
>>> next(c)
Blastoff!
StopIteration
```

Separate calls to `countdown` will create distinct generator objects with their own state. Usually, generators shouldn't restart. If you'd like to reset the sequence, create another generator object by calling the generator function again.

```py
>>> c1, c2 = countdown(5), countdown(5)
>>> c1 is c2
False
>>> next(c1)
5
>>> next(c2)
5
```

Here is a summary of the above:

- A *generator function* has a `yield` statement and returns a *generator object*.
- Calling the `iter` function on a generator object returns the same object without modifying its current state.
- The body of a generator function is not evaluated until `next` is called on a resulting generator object. Calling the `next` function on a generator object computes and returns the next object in its sequence. If the sequence is exhausted, `StopIteration` is raised.
- A generator "remembers" its state for the next `next` call. Therefore,
    - the first `next` call works like this:
        1. Enter the function and run until the line with `yield`.
        2. Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.
    - And subsequent `next` calls work like this:
        1. Re-enter the function, start at **the line after the** `yield` **statement that was previously executed**, and run until the next `yield` statement.
        2. Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.
- Calling a generator function returns a brand new generator object (like calling `iter` on an iterable object).
- A generator should not restart unless it's defined that way. To start over from the first element in a generator, just call the generator function again to create a new generator.

Another useful tool for generators is the `yield from` statement. `yield from` will yield all values from an iterator or iterable.

```py
>>> def gen_list(lst):
...     yield from lst
...
>>> g = gen_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> next(g)
1
>>> next(g)
2
>>> next(g)
3
>>> next(g)
4
>>> next(g)
StopIteration
```

# Required Questions

## Iterators & Generators

### Q1: Repeated

Implement `repeated`, which takes in an iterator `t` and returns the first value in `t` that appears `k` times in a row.

> **Note:** You can assume that the iterator `t` will have a value that appears at least `k` times in a row. If you are receiving a `StopIteration`, your `repeated` function is likely not identifying the correct value.

Your implementation should iterate through the items in a way such that if the same iterator is passed into `repeated` twice, it should continue in the second call at the point it left off in the first. An example of this behavior is in the doctests.

```py
def repeated(t, k):
    """Return the first value in iterator T that appears K times in a row.
    Iterate through the items such that if the same iterator is passed into
    the function twice, it continues in the second call at the point it left
    off in the first.

    >>> s = iter([10, 9, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, 8, 7])
    >>> repeated(s, 2)
    9
    >>> s2 = iter([10, 9, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, 8, 7])
    >>> repeated(s2, 3)
    8
    >>> s = iter([3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5])
    >>> repeated(s, 3)
    2
    >>> repeated(s, 3)
    5
    >>> s2 = iter([4, 1, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 5])
    >>> repeated(s2, 3)
    2
    """
    assert k > 1
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q repeated
```

### Q2: Merge

Implement `merge(incr_a, incr_b)`, which takes two iterables `incr_a` and `incr_b` whose elements are ordered. `merge` yields elements from `incr_a` and `incr_b` in sorted order, eliminating repetition. You may assume `incr_a` and `incr_b` themselves do not contain repeats, and that none of the elements of either are `None`. You may **not** assume that the iterables are finite; either may produce an infinite stream of results.

You will probably find it helpful to use the two-argument version of the built-in `next` function: `next(incr, v)` is the same as `next(incr)`, except that instead of raising `StopIteration` when `incr` runs out of elements, it returns `v`.

See the doctest for examples of behavior.

```py
def merge(incr_a, incr_b):
    """Yield the elements of strictly increasing iterables incr_a and incr_b, removing
    repeats. Assume that incr_a and incr_b have no repeats. incr_a or incr_b may or may not
    be infinite sequences.

    >>> m = merge([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14], [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15])
    >>> type(m)
    <class 'generator'>
    >>> list(m)
    [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15]
    >>> def big(n):
    ...    k = 0
    ...    while True: yield k; k += n
    >>> m = merge(big(2), big(3))
    >>> [next(m) for _ in range(11)]
    [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15]
    """
    iter_a, iter_b = iter(incr_a), iter(incr_b)
    next_a, next_b = next(iter_a, None), next(iter_b, None)
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q merge
```

## Linked Lists & Trees

### Q3: Deep Linked List Length

A linked list that contains one or more linked lists as elements is called a deep linked list. Write a function `deep_len` that takes in a (possibly deep) linked list and returns the *deep length* of that linked list. The deep length of a linked list is the total number of non-link elements in the list, as well as the total number of elements contained in all contained lists. See the function's doctests for examples of the deep length of linked lists.

> **Hint:** Use `isinstance` to check if something is an instance of an object.

```py
def deep_len(lnk):
    """ Returns the deep length of a possibly deep linked list.

    >>> deep_len(Link(1, Link(2, Link(3))))
    3
    >>> deep_len(Link(Link(1, Link(2)), Link(3, Link(4))))
    4
    >>> levels = Link(Link(Link(1, Link(2)), \
            Link(3)), Link(Link(4), Link(5)))
    >>> print(levels)
    <<<1 2> 3> <4> 5>
    >>> deep_len(levels)
    5
    """
    if ______________:
        return 0
    elif ______________:
        return 1
    else:
        return _________________________
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q deep_len
```

### Q4: Add Leaves

Implement `add_d_leaves`, a function that takes in a `Tree` instance `t` and a number `v`.

We define the depth of a node in `t` to be the number of edges from the root to that node. The depth of root is therefore 0.

For each node in the tree, you should add `d` leaves to it, where `d` is the depth of the node. Every added leaf should have a label of `v`. If the node at this depth has existing branches, you should add these leaves to the end of that list of branches.

For example, you should be adding 1 leaf with label `v` to each node at depth 1, 2 leaves to each node at depth 2, and so on.

Here is an example of a tree `t`(shown on the left) and the result after `add_d_leaves` is applied with `v` as 5.

> Try drawing out the second doctest to visualize how the function is mutating `t3`.

> **Hint:** Use a helper function to keep track of the depth!

```py
def add_d_leaves(t, v):
    """Add d leaves containing v to each node at every depth d.

    >>> t_one_to_four = Tree(1, [Tree(2), Tree(3, [Tree(4)])])

## Efficiency

### Q5: Efficiency Practice

Choose the term that fills in the blank for the functions defined below: `<function>` runs in `____` time in the length of its input.

- Constant
- Logarithmic
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Exponential
- None of these

Assume that `len` runs in constant time and `all` runs in linear time in the length of its input. Selecting an element of a list by its index requires constant time. Constructing a range requires constant time.

```py
def count_partitions(n, m):
    """Counts the number of partitions of a positive integer n, 
    using parts up to size m."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 0
    elif m == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        with_m = count_partitions(n-m, m)
        without_m = count_partitions(n, m-1)
        return with_m + without_m

def is_palindrome(s):
    """Return whether a list of numbers s is a palindrome."""
    return all([s[i] == s[len(s) - i - 1] for i in range(len(s))])

def binary_search(lst, n):
    """Takes in a sorted list lst and returns the index where integer n
    is contained in lst. Returns -1 if n does not exist in lst."""
    low = 0
    high = len(lst)
    while low <= high:
        middle = (low + high) // 2
        if lst[middle] == n:
            return middle
        elif n < lst[middle]:
            high = middle - 1
        else:
            low = middle + 1

## Recursion and Tree Recursion

### Q6: Subsequences

A subsequence of a sequence `S` is a subset of elements from `S`, in the same order they appear in `S`. Consider the list `[1, 2, 3]`. Here are a few of it's subsequences `[]`, `[1, 3]`, `[2]`, and `[1, 2, 3]`.

Write a function that takes in a list and returns all possible subsequences of that list. The subsequences should be returned as a list of lists, where each nested list is a subsequence of the original input.

In order to accomplish this, you might first want to write a function `insert_into_all` that takes an item and a list of lists, adds the item to the beginning of each nested list, and returns the resulting list.

```py
def insert_into_all(item, nested_list):
    """Return a new list consisting of all the lists in nested_list,
    but with item added to the front of each. You can assume that
     nested_list is a list of lists.

    >>> nl = [[], [1, 2], [3]]
    >>> insert_into_all(0, nl)
    [[0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 3]]
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def subseqs(s):
    """Return a nested list (a list of lists) of all subsequences of S.
    The subsequences can appear in any order. You can assume S is a list.

    >>> seqs = subseqs([1, 2, 3])
    >>> sorted(seqs)
    [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
    >>> subseqs([])
    [[]]
    """
    if ________________:
        ________________
    else:
        ________________
        ________________
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q subseqs
```

### Q7: Non-Decreasing Subsequences

Just like the last question, we want to write a function that takes a list and returns a list of lists, where each individual list is a subsequence of the original input.

This time we have another condition: we only want the subsequences for which consecutive elements are nondecreasing. For example, `[1, 3, 2]` is a subsequence of `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, but since 2 < 3, this subsequence would not be included in our result.

**Fill in the blanks** to complete the implementation of the `non_decrease_subseqs` function. You may assume that the input list contains no negative elements.

You may use the provided helper function `insert_into_all`, which takes in an `item` and a list of lists and inserts the `item` to the front of each list.

```py
def non_decrease_subseqs(s):
    """Assuming that S is a list, return a nested list of all subsequences
    of S (a list of lists) for which the elements of the subsequence
    are strictly nondecreasing. The subsequences can appear in any order.

    >>> seqs = non_decrease_subseqs([1, 3, 2])
    >>> sorted(seqs)
    [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2], [3]]
    >>> non_decrease_subseqs([])
    [[]]
    >>> seqs2 = non_decrease_subseqs([1, 1, 2])
    >>> sorted(seqs2)
    [[], [1], [1], [1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [2]]
    """
    def subseq_helper(s, prev):
        if not s:
            return ____________________
        elif s[0] < prev:
            return ____________________
        else:
            a = ______________________
            b = ______________________
            return insert_into_all(________, ______________) + ________________
    return subseq_helper(____, ____)
```

```py
python3 ok -q non_decrease_subseqs
```

## Mutable Lists

### Q8: Shuffle

Define a function `shuffle` that takes a sequence with an even number of elements (cards) and creates a new list that interleaves the elements of the first half with the elements of the second half.

To interleave two sequences `s0` and `s1` is to create a new sequence such that the new sequence contains (in this order) the first element of `s0`, the first element of `s1`, the second element of `s0`, the second element of `s1`, and so on. If the two lists are not the same length, then the leftover elements of the longer list should still appear at the end.

## Generators & Iterators

### Q9: Pairs (generator)

Write a generator function `pairs` that takes a list and yields all the possible pairs of elements from that list.

```py
def pairs(lst):
    """
    >>> type(pairs([3, 4, 5]))
    <class 'generator'>
    >>> for x, y in pairs([3, 4, 5]):
    ...     print(x, y)
    ...
    3 3
    3 4
    3 5
    4 3
    4 4
    4 5
    5 3
    5 4
    5 5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q pairs
```

### Q10: Pairs (iterator)

> **Important note (March 14):** This question is **not** in scope for this semester (Spring 2022), as it involves `__iter__` and `__next__`.

Now write an iterator that does the same thing. You are only allowed to use a linear amount of space - so computing a list of all of the possible pairs is not a valid answer. Notice how much harder it is - this is why generators are useful.

```py
class PairsIterator:
    """
    >>> for x, y in PairsIterator([3, 4, 5]):
    ...     print(x, y)
    ...
    3 3
    3 4
    3 5
    4 3
    4 4
    4 5
    5 3
    5 4
    5 5
    """
    def __init__(self, lst):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

    def __next__(self):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

    def __iter__(self):
        "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q PairsIterator
```

## Trees

### Q11: Long Paths

Implement `long_paths`, which returns a list of all paths in a tree with length at least `n`. A path in a tree is a linked list of node values that starts with the root and ends at a leaf. Each subsequent element must be from a child of the previous value's node. The *length* of a path is the number of edges in the path (i.e. one less than the number of nodes in the path). Paths are listed in order from left to right. See the doctests for some examples.

```py
def long_paths(tree, n):
    """Return a list of all paths in tree with length at least n.

    >>> t = Tree(3, [Tree(4), Tree(4), Tree(5)])
    >>> left = Tree(1, [Tree(2), t])
    >>> mid = Tree(6, [Tree(7, [Tree(8)]), Tree(9)])
    >>> right = Tree(11, [Tree(12, [Tree(13, [Tree(14)])])])
    >>> whole = Tree(0, [left, Tree(13), mid, right])
    >>> for path in long_paths(whole, 2):
    ...     print(path)
    ...
    <0 1 2>
    <0 1 3 4>
    <0 1 3 4>
    <0 1 3 5>
    <0 6 7 8>
    <0 6 9>
    <0 11 12 13 14>
    >>> for path in long_paths(whole, 3):
    ...     print(path)
    ...
    <0 1 3 4>
    <0 1 3 4>
    <0 1 3 5>
    <0 6 7 8>
    <0 11 12 13 14>
    >>> long_paths(whole, 4)
    [Link(0, Link(11, Link(12, Link(13, Link(14)))))]
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q long_paths
```

## Linked Lists

### Q12: Flip Two

Write a recursive function `flip_two` that takes as input a linked list `s` and mutates `s` so that every pair of values in the linked list is flipped.

```py
def flip_two(s):
    """
    >>> one_lnk = Link(1)
    >>> flip_two(one_lnk)
    >>> one_lnk
    Link(1)
    >>> lnk = Link(1, Link(2, Link(3, Link(4, Link(5)))))
    >>> flip_two(lnk)
    >>> lnk
    Link(2, Link(1, Link(4, Link(3, Link(5)))))
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

    # For an extra challenge, try writing out an iterative approach as well below!
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Use Ok to test your code:

```py
python3 ok -q flip_two
```
